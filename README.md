# Light_Monitory_Sytem
I built a light monitory system using BOLT_IOT module
Overview:
The light monitory system uses the LDR sensor to record the light at particular time stamp in the place where the module is kept and gives you real time data for every 5 mins.
Things Used in the Project:
BOLT_IOT module
LDR sensor
10k ohm resistor
Working:
So basically it takes the input from LDR sensor at a particular time and records the amount of light,
Amount of light in inversely proportional to the resistance of the resistor by which it calculates the amount of light in the particular region
